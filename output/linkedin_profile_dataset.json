Located in San Luis Obispo, 200 miles north of Los Angeles, Cal Poly maintains a guiding philosophy of “Learn By Doing” that is reflected in the school’s comprehensive curriculum combining technical and professional training with the arts and humanities. When you graduate from Cal Poly, you won’t just know theory you will be able to think critically and know how to solve real-world problems. Today, Cal Poly is among the most selective public universities in the United States. Under President Armstrong’s leadership, Cal Poly’s national reputation is growing and, according to payscale.com, the return on investment for graduating students is consistently on a par with some of the most prestigious universities in California.

We’re harnessing our power to find innovative solutions to the world’s most daunting challenges — and preparing the next generation of leaders while we’re at it.\n\nThe university offers more than 100 majors in four colleges — Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, and Letters and Science.

With over 20 years of experience in sales, I've had the privilege of navigating a wide range of challenges and opportunities. Through it all, I’ve learned that the one thing that truly moves the needle is, Trust.\n\nIt’s not just about the number of calls, CRM systems, or clever go-to-market strategies (though those matter). It’s about building trust—trust that I deliver on my promises, that I can drive measurable growth, and that I genuinely understand the needs of my customers. Trust forms the foundation of every successful relationship, whether it’s with clients, colleagues, or leadership teams. It’s how I’ve built lasting partnerships and consistently hit ambitious goals.\n\nThis focus on trust is rooted in a strong set of core principles that guide me in life and work. Persistence, courage, creativity, and expertise are key components of my success, but principles like integrity and accountability are what sustains it. These values have helped me excel in every role, becoming a consistent top performer and helped me be successful in whatever role I've played.",

      "description": "The University of Utah, located in Salt Lake City in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains, is the flagship institution of higher learning in Utah. Founded in 1850, it serves over 31,000 students from across the U.S. and the world. With over 72 major subjects at the undergraduate level and more than 90 major fields of study at the graduate level, including law and medicine, the university prepares students to live and compete in the global workplace. Known for its proximity to seven world-class ski resorts within 40 minutes of campus, the U encourages an active, holistic lifestyle, innovation and collaborative thinking to engage students, faculty and business leaders.\r\n\r\nThe University of Utah became a member of the PAC-12 conference in July 2011.\r\n\r\nTechnology and Commercialization\r\nThe University of Utah is tops in the country for creating start-up companies from university research, according to a ranking by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM). See http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/u-of-utah-no-1-for-startups for more information.\r\n\r\nForbes magazine’s recent ranking of the “Best States for Business” pointed to “an educated labor force” as a big reason Utah came in at number one. The U supplies many of the employees for companies that keep expanding their operations in Utah, such as Goldman Sachs, Adobe, Omniture, Oracle, Ebay and many others. http://pac12info.utah.edu/commercialization-of-innovation/\r\n\r\nHealthcare\r\nUniversity of Utah Health Care recently ranked first in the nation in a prestigious national study. The University Health System Consortium’s 2010 Quality and Accountability Study compared 98 of the nation’s top academic medical centers and ranked them based on core quality measures, patient safety indicators, mortality rates, re-admission rates, and patient satisfaction scores.
